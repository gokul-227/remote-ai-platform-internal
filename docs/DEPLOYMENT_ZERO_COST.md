# $0 Deployment Guide

Target architecture, all genuinely free tiers, no payment method required for any of them:

| Layer | Provider | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend | Vercel (Hobby) | Native Next.js support, free subdomain |
| API | Render (Free web service) | Free container hosting; see cold-start caveat below |
| Database | Supabase (Free Postgres) | Render's free Postgres is temporary — do not use it (see `infra/deploy/render.yaml`) |
| File storage | Supabase Storage (S3-compatible) | Free tier, no card required; verified compatible with this app's boto3 client (see below) |
| Scheduled job sync | GitHub Actions cron | Replaces Celery beat — no hosted Redis/worker needed |
| CI | GitHub Actions | Already wired in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` |

No Redis, no Celery worker/beat, no self-hosted Keycloak are deployed to production. Here's why each is
safe to drop, verified against the actual code (not assumed):
- **Redis**: `RateLimitMiddleware` is in-process (works with zero Redis). The network chat's cross-worker
  Redis pub/sub automatically falls back to local in-memory broadcast if Redis is unavailable — and a
  single free-tier instance has no "other workers" to broadcast to anyway.
- **Celery/beat**: only used for the 3 scheduled jobs (source sync, trending-skills refresh, stale-match
  recompute). Source sync is replaced by `.github/workflows/scheduled-job-sync.yml`. The other two are
  lower-value for an MVP and can be triggered manually via the admin console if needed later.
- **Keycloak**: confirmed by reading `apps/api/app/domains/auth/router.py` — registration sets
  `keycloak_id=str(uuid.uuid4())`, a locally generated placeholder. The app never makes a network call to
  a real Keycloak server for login/register/token verification. It's present in `docker-compose.yml` for
  local dev only; production doesn't need it running anywhere.

## Prerequisites you need to do (I cannot do these — no payment method needed for any of them)

### 1. Supabase project (database + storage)

1. Create a free project at supabase.com (no card required for the free tier).
2. **Database**: Project Settings → Database → copy the connection string. Use the pooler's
   **session-mode** port, **5432**, not transaction-mode port 6543 — confirmed live: transaction mode's
   PgBouncer hands the same backend connection to different clients without deallocating asyncpg's prior
   prepared statement, causing `DuplicatePreparedStatementError` that gets worse the more connections hit
   it (see `docs/ACTUAL_SYSTEM_AUDIT.md`). Session mode gives each client a dedicated backend, avoiding
   this entirely, and is fine at this app's low single-instance traffic. The pooler username is
   `postgres.<project-ref>` (not just `postgres`), and if the password contains any URL-special character
   (`@`, `:`, `/`, `%`, etc.) it must be percent-encoded (Python: `urllib.parse.quote(password, safe="")`)
   before embedding it in the URL. Final form:
   `postgresql+asyncpg://postgres.<project-ref>:<percent-encoded-password>@<pooler-host>:5432/postgres`
3. **Storage**: Project Settings → Storage → S3 Connection. Create two buckets: `remote-ai-platform-resumes`
   (keep private) and `remote-ai-platform-assets` (can be public). Generate an S3 access key/secret pair
   from the storage settings page.
   - `MINIO_ENDPOINT` = `<project-ref>.supabase.co/storage/v1/s3` (this app's storage client now uses
     boto3 specifically because it — unlike the previous minio SDK — supports a path component in the
     endpoint URL; verified locally against MinIO's own S3-compatible API in this same code path, see
     `docs/ACTUAL_SYSTEM_AUDIT.md`. If Supabase's exact endpoint format differs when you set this up,
     the fix is only ever in `_endpoint_url()` in `apps/api/app/core/storage.py`, not a re-architecture.)
   - `MINIO_ACCESS_KEY` / `MINIO_SECRET_KEY` = the S3 keys from that page
   - `MINIO_SECURE` = `true`
4. Run migrations against this database once, from your machine (needs Python 3.11 — use the Docker
   `test` image if you don't have 3.11 installed, same as local dev):
   ```bash
   docker run --rm -e DATABASE_URL="postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:<password>@<host>:5432/postgres" \
     -e JWT_SECRET_KEY="temporary-for-migration-only-32-chars-min" \
     remote-ai-platform-test alembic upgrade head
   ```

### 2. Render (API)

1. Create a free account at render.com (no card required for free web services).
2. New → Blueprint → point at this repo, it will read `infra/deploy/render.yaml`.
3. In the Render dashboard, set these env vars manually (not committed to git):
   - `DATABASE_URL` — from Supabase, step 1
   - `JWT_SECRET_KEY` — generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`
   - `CORS_ORIGINS` — your Vercel URL once you have it (step 3), e.g. `https://remote-ai-platform.vercel.app`
   - `MINIO_ENDPOINT`, `MINIO_ACCESS_KEY`, `MINIO_SECRET_KEY`, `MINIO_SECURE` — from Supabase, step 1
   - `MINIO_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT` — same as `MINIO_ENDPOINT` with `https://` prefix
   - `KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET` — any random string (not used for real verification, but
     `validate_production_settings()` rejects the placeholder default at boot — see
     `apps/api/app/core/config.py`)
   - `AI_PROVIDER` = `groq`, `AI_API_KEY` = a free Groq API key from console.groq.com (no card required)
     — optional; if omitted, AI features degrade gracefully to generic defaults rather than failing
     (already verified in `docs/ACTUAL_SYSTEM_AUDIT.md`'s AI-degradation section)
4. Deploy. **Cold start**: Render's free tier spins the service down after ~15 minutes idle; the next
   request takes 10-60 seconds to wake it up. Not fixable at $0 — document it as a known limitation, don't
   try to work around it with a paid tier or a keep-alive ping (that just burns the free tier's monthly
   request/hour budget for no real benefit).

### 3. Vercel (frontend)

1. Create a free account at vercel.com (no card required for Hobby tier).
2. Import this repo, set **Root Directory** to `apps/web` in project settings (monorepo — `apps/web/vercel.json`
   handles installing from the repo root so npm workspaces resolve correctly).
3. Set env var `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` = your **bare** Render API URL, with **no** `/api/v1` suffix — e.g.
   `https://remote-ai-platform-api.onrender.com`. Both `apps/web/src/lib/api.ts` and
   `apps/web/src/hooks/useMessages.ts` append `/api/v1` themselves; setting it with the suffix already
   included causes every request to hit a doubled `/api/v1/api/v1/...` path and 404 (confirmed live —
   see `docs/ACTUAL_SYSTEM_AUDIT.md`).
4. `turbo.json`'s `build` task already declares `"env": ["NEXT_PUBLIC_*"]` — this is required, not optional:
   without it Turborepo's cache doesn't know an env var affects the build, and silently keeps serving an
   old cached build even after you change the value in Vercel's dashboard (confirmed live).
5. Deploy. Do not add a custom domain — use the free `*.vercel.app` subdomain.

### 4. GitHub Actions secrets (for the scheduled job sync)

In this repo's Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions:
- Secret `PROD_ADMIN_EMAIL` / `PROD_ADMIN_PASSWORD` — credentials of an admin account that exists on the
  deployed database (the seed script creates `admin@workmesh.ai` / `admin123` — **change this password in
  production** before relying on it, or create a separate admin account).
- Variable `PROD_API_URL` — e.g. `https://remote-ai-platform-api.onrender.com/api/v1`

## What to hand back to me once these exist

Once you've done the above, tell me and share (not the secrets themselves, just confirmation + URLs):
- The Render service URL
- The Vercel deployment URL
- Confirmation the Supabase migration ran cleanly

I'll then run the same acceptance checklist against the live URLs that Phase 0 ran locally (register →
login → jobs → matching → admin dashboard → resume upload), and report back honestly which parts work
against the real deployment versus what only worked locally.

## Known free-tier limitations (be upfront about these, don't hide them)

- **Render cold starts**: 10-60s wake-up after 15 min idle. Real product impact: the first visitor after
  a quiet period waits.
- **Supabase free Postgres**: pauses after 7 days with zero activity (resumes automatically on next
  connection, takes ~1 minute). The GitHub Actions job-sync cron running every 6h should keep it from ever
  going idle for that long.
- **No Redis in production**: rate limiting is per-instance (fine for a single free Render instance,
  would need revisiting if ever scaled to multiple instances). Chat falls back to local broadcast (also
  fine for a single instance).
- **AI features require a free Groq key to do anything beyond generic defaults.** Groq's free tier has its
  own rate limits; under load, resume parsing/job enrichment will silently degrade further (already
  graceful, not a crash) — this is inherent to using a free AI tier, not a bug in this app.
- **Celery beat's other two scheduled jobs (trending-skills refresh, stale-match recompute) are not
  replaced by a GitHub Actions cron in this pass** — only job-source sync is. They can be triggered
  manually via a follow-up admin action if needed, or a second scheduled workflow added later the same way.
