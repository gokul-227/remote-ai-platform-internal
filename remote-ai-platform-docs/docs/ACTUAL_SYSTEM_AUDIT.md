# Actual System Audit

**Method**: execution-verified, not documentation-derived. Produced 2026-08-11 by booting the
real local stack (Docker Compose), hitting live endpoints, and reading the actual source of every
domain/screen named below. Superscript refs are file:line evidence gathered during this pass.

## Why this doc exists

`docs/` already contained ~30 prior status/audit files (`FORENSIC_AUDIT.md`, `FINAL_ENGINEERING_REPORT.md`,
`AGENT_STATE.md`, `CURRENT_STATE.md`, `VERIFICATION_MATRIX.md`, etc.), written across at least three
separate "we are done" cycles between 2026-08-08 and 2026-08-09. Each "100% complete" claim was
contradicted by a forensic pass within hours — most notably `AGENT_STATE.md` claiming "ALL 21 PHASES
COMPLETE, Known Bugs: None identified" three hours before `FORENSIC_AUDIT.md` found a P0 `ImportError`
crash-looping the API container and the live DB 13 migrations behind head. The most recent doc cycle
(2026-08-09) is already 4 commits stale with no update trail. **Do not trust any status claim in the
other docs files without re-verifying it against running code.** This file supersedes them for
current-state questions; it will itself go stale the moment the code changes again, so re-verify before
relying on it in a future session.

## Feature status

| Feature | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Docker Compose stack boot | **WORKING** | All 8 core containers (postgres, redis, minio, keycloak, api, web, celery-worker, celery-beat) healthy; verified live 2026-08-11. |
| DB migrations | **WORKING** | `alembic heads` inside the api container → `022_groups (head)`, 43 tables present via `\dt`. Bare-metal Python 3.11 venv path is unverifiable on a machine without `python3.11` installed — this is an environment gap, not a code gap. |
| Health/OpenAPI endpoints | **WORKING** | `GET /api/v1/health` → 200 with real DB/queue status. Note: `GET /health` (no `/api/v1` prefix) is 404 — the route is namespaced under the versioned prefix, unlike what a bare `/health` reference might suggest. |
| Registration / login / JWT issuance | **WORKING** | Live `POST /api/v1/auth/register` → `POST /api/v1/auth/login` round-trip returns real access/refresh tokens and provisions a Keycloak identity synchronously. |
| Keycloak OIDC signature verification | **BROKEN (docstring lies)** | `AuthService.verify_token` claims Keycloak OIDC integration but only does `jwt.decode(token, JWT_SECRET_KEY, algorithms=["HS256"])` against the app's own local shared secret — no JWKS fetch, no RS256 verification anywhere in the codebase. It cannot actually validate a token signed by a real Keycloak server; it only validates the app's own self-issued tokens. Functionally fine for this app's own auth flow (which is self-issued, not federated), but the docstring overclaims and should be fixed or the design intent clarified. |
| Role-based authorization (engineer/company/admin) | **WORKING**, one dead import | `require_role()` is genuinely wired via `Depends()` across 40+ endpoints (matching, admin, projects, applications, jobs, companies). `trust/router.py` imports `require_role` but never calls it — its GET endpoints are intentionally public (trust scores/reviews are public data) but the unused import should be removed or the intent documented. |
| Rate limiting | **PARTIALLY_WORKING** | Real in-process sliding-window limiter, not a stub (contradicts stale `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md`). Only guards 3 hardcoded paths (`/auth/login`, `/auth/register`, `/engineers/me/resume`) — everything else is unlimited. In-process (per-worker) state means it won't coordinate across multiple API replicas; fine for single-instance free-tier deploy, a real gap at scale. |
| Job aggregators (RemoteOK, Arbeitnow, Remotive, USAJobs, TheMuse) | **WORKING** | All 5 make real HTTP calls, guard non-200/timeout/malformed responses, and each failure is isolated per-source in `sync_all_job_sources` — one broken source doesn't abort the sync loop. `USAJobs` short-circuits cleanly if its API key isn't configured. |
| Job dedup | **WORKING** | `JobRepository.upsert_external_job` keys on `external_id`; update-in-place vs create-new is correct. |
| Job search/filter | **WORKING** | Live `GET /api/v1/jobs` returns real stored jobs (20 present after seed) with source/is_active fields; backend-driven, not frontend-only filtering. |
| Matching engine — determinism | **WORKING** | Confirmed rules-based arithmetic, zero LLM calls in the scoring path. Weighted sum (skill 40% / experience 25% / role 15% / timezone 8% / availability 7% / compensation 3% / remote 2%) sums to 1.00. |
| Matching engine — timezone/remote sub-scores | **PARTIALLY_WORKING (bug)** | `timezone_score` and `remote_score` don't actually compare the relevant values — `timezone_score` only checks whether both `job.remote_preference` and `engineer.timezone` are truthy (never compares actual timezones); `remote_score` checks truthiness of a lowercased string rather than any real preference match. Low blast radius (8% + 2% of the weighted total) but the field names promise more than the code delivers — should be fixed before calling matching "explainable." |
| Matching engine — score bounds | **WORKING (implicit, not enforced)** | No explicit `max(0, min(100, ...))` clamp on `overall_score`, but every sub-score is individually bounded 40–100 by construction so it can't currently escape [40,100] given current weights. Fragile if a sub-score formula changes later without re-deriving the bound — worth adding an explicit clamp defensively. |
| AI provider abstraction (LiteLLM only) | **WORKING** | Zero direct `openai`/`anthropic`/`google.generativeai` imports anywhere in `apps/api`. Confirmed via full-tree grep. |
| AI graceful degradation | **PARTIALLY_WORKING** | `LLMClient.complete()` never raises — on total provider failure it returns `"{}"`, and callers (`ResumeParserAgent`, `JobEnricherAgent`) fall back to generic defaults (`"Software Engineer"` headline, `"mid"` experience level, empty skill lists) rather than crashing. This is graceful in that the app stays up, but it's a **silent** degrade — a user gets a technically-200 response with near-empty AI output and no visible signal that AI was unavailable. No deterministic keyword-extraction fallback exists (the mega-prompt's "PDF extraction → deterministic skill dictionary → optional LLM" design is not what's implemented; it's "LLM or nothing useful"). |
| Networking/chat (connections + WebSocket messaging) | **WORKING** | Real `Connection`/`Conversation`/`Message` models, real WebSocket endpoint (`/messages/ws/{conversation_id}`) with token-auth, and real Redis pub/sub cross-worker fan-out with an in-memory local fallback if Redis is down. Frontend genuinely opens this socket and falls back to REST POST if the socket isn't open. This is a substantially complete chat system, not a stub — contrary to what a "networking may be unfinished" framing might assume. |
| Social feed | **WORKING** (per source read; not live-exercised) | Real models/router/schemas, documented as deterministic "connections + self posts, recency-sorted." Not hit live in this pass. |
| Project workspace (milestones/tasks/escrow/ledger/AI reports) | **WORKING** (per source + frontend cross-check; deep logic not fully verified) | Both backend (`projects/router.py`, 768 lines, role-gated per endpoint) and frontend (`useProject.ts`, full milestones/tasks/submissions/ledger/payments/reviews UI) are real and wired together. Not exercised live end-to-end (no project was created/progressed in this pass) — flag as verified-by-code-reading, not verified-by-execution. |
| `marketplace` domain | **DOCUMENTED_ONLY / dead code** | Has only `models.py`; its router is never registered in `main.py`, and no frontend hook references it. Not broken — simply unused. Either wire it up or remove it; leaving it is harmless but confusing. |
| Frontend auth (register/login/refresh) | **WORKING** | Real POSTs, real 401→refresh→retry-once interceptor, tokens in `localStorage`. |
| Frontend engineer flow (profile, resume upload, recommendations, applications) | **WORKING**, one cosmetic gap | Recommendations page shows real 6-factor score breakdown + AI reasoning + skill gaps. Engineer dashboard's job-list "match" pill is a static em dash placeholder (the dashboard's job list isn't the scored feed) — cosmetic, not fake data; real scores are one click away. |
| Frontend company flow (profile, job posting, candidate discovery) | **PARTIALLY_WORKING** | Candidate-matching view (`company/candidates`) is fully real with genuine scores/reasoning. Company **dashboard** has 3 real gaps: a hardcoded "Skill Matches" stat card, a `match_score` field displayed per-candidate that the backend never populates (no such field exists on the engineers list endpoint), and a dead "save candidate" star button with no `onClick` handler. |
| Frontend admin dashboard | **WORKING** | All stat/log/health panels backed by real parallel API calls; the only static array is an explicit fallback used when the live health-detail call fails, not a fake primary path. |
| CI/CD | **WORKING (added this pass)** | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` added — backend test/migrations + frontend lint/typecheck/build, every step pre-verified locally before being committed. Was empty prior to this session; `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md`'s prior claim that CI was "✅ DONE" was false at the time it was written. |
| Deployment configs (Render/Vercel/Fly/Netlify) | **NOT_IMPLEMENTED** | Zero deploy-config files anywhere (`render.yaml`, `vercel.json`, `fly.toml`, `netlify.toml`, `app.yaml` — none exist). Dockerfiles for both `apps/api` and `apps/web` are solid and container-deploy-ready, but nothing platform-specific has been written yet. |
| Automated tests (backend) | **WORKING — 93/93 passing** | Couldn't run via a bare venv (no Python 3.11 interpreter on this machine; committed venvs are version-mismatched). Ran via `docker compose -f infra/docker/docker-compose.yml run --rm test`, which uses the Dockerfile's pinned Python 3.11 `test` target — 93/93 passed, confirmed twice (once pre-fix, once post-fix to confirm the matching-engine change didn't break `test_matching.py`). This is the one prior-docs claim that held up under re-verification. |
| Automated tests (frontend) | **NOT_IMPLEMENTED** | No jest/vitest/playwright installed, no test script in `apps/web/package.json`, `tests/e2e/` at repo root is empty. |
| Committed secrets | **CONFIRMED CLEAN** | No `.env` ever committed to git history; no live-looking API key/secret patterns in tracked files. |

## Phase 2 fixes applied and verified (2026-08-11)

All of the following were fixed and re-verified by actually running the affected code, not just edited
and assumed correct:

1. **Matching engine timezone/remote sub-scores** (`apps/api/app/domains/matching/service.py`) — replaced
   the truthiness-only checks with real content comparisons: `timezone_score` now compares the job's
   free-text timezone/region constraint against the engineer's free-text timezone; `remote_score` now
   compares job `is_remote` against the engineer's actual `remote_preference` value (remote/hybrid/onsite)
   instead of just checking the string is non-empty. Backend test suite re-run after the change: still
   93/93 passing.
2. **`AuthService.verify_token` / `get_current_user` docstrings** — corrected to state plainly that these
   validate self-issued HS256 tokens (signed with the app's own `JWT_SECRET_KEY`), not Keycloak-signed
   RS256/JWKS tokens, and that there is no DEBUG-mode mock-user fallback. Behavior unchanged — this was a
   documentation-accuracy fix, not a functional change. (Implementing real Keycloak signature verification,
   if actually desired, is separate follow-up work — not done here.)
3. **Company dashboard** (`apps/web/src/app/company/dashboard/page.tsx`) — removed the fake `match_score`
   pill and dead "save" star button per candidate (there is no backend "save engineer" feature anywhere in
   the codebase — this isn't a wiring gap, it's a genuinely missing feature; pretending it works via a dead
   button was worse than removing it). Replaced the hardcoded "Skill Matches" stat with a real
   "Applications Received" count from the already-existing `useCompanyApplications` hook. Candidate rows now
   link to the real `/engineers/{id}` public profile route. Verified: `tsc --noEmit`, `eslint`, and
   `next build` all pass clean on the changed file.
4. **`trust/router.py`** — removed the unused `require_role` import.
5. **CI added** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) — three jobs: backend (ruff + mypy, both non-blocking pending
   the pre-existing lint debt below; pytest via the Docker `test` service, blocking), frontend (lint,
   `tsc --noEmit`, `next build`, all blocking), and migrations (alembic `upgrade head` against a fresh
   Postgres service container, blocking). **Every step in this workflow was manually executed against the
   current tree before being added** — this isn't aspirational CI, it's CI encoding checks that were just
   confirmed to pass: 93/93 backend tests, clean frontend lint/typecheck/build, and clean migrations from
   an empty database.

## Security audit results (2026-08-11) — Phase 9

Full audit of CORS, IDOR, file upload, SSRF, SQLi, XSS, WebSocket auth, debug-mode leakage, password
handling, and admin endpoint gating, verified by reading code and hitting the live stack. Findings from
the earlier auth/rate-limit pass (Keycloak RS256, rate-limit path coverage, no committed secrets) are not
repeated here.

**Fixed, and the exact cross-tenant reproduction re-run to confirm the fix:**

1. **CRITICAL — broken access control on `POST /payments/escrow`** (`apps/api/app/domains/payments/router.py`).
   The endpoint checked that `project_id` and `payee_id` existed but never checked the caller's company
   actually owned the project — any authenticated company could create escrow transactions against *any*
   project in the system. Reproduced live: Company B created a `201` escrow transaction against Company
   A's project before the fix. Fixed by adding the same ownership check `projects/router.py` already uses
   elsewhere. Re-verified live after the fix: the identical request now returns `403 {"detail":"Project
   access required"}`; the legitimate same-owner case still returns `201`.
2. **HIGH — same missing-ownership-check pattern on `POST /contracts`** (`apps/api/app/domains/contracts/router.py`).
   `project_id` was accepted and attached to a new contract without validating it belonged to the caller's
   company — not even a `db.get()` existence check. Reproduced live pre-fix (`201` for a cross-tenant
   contract), fixed with the same ownership check, re-verified live post-fix (`403`).
3. **LOW — registration password minimum was 6 characters** (`apps/api/app/domains/auth/schemas.py`),
   inconsistent with the frontend's own zod validation which already required 8. Raised backend minimum to
   8 to match.
4. **LOW — no production-boot guard against a CORS wildcard** (`apps/api/app/core/config.py`). Current
   `CORS_ORIGINS` default is a safe explicit allowlist, not a wildcard — this was not exploitable today,
   but unlike `JWT_SECRET_KEY`/`KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET`/`MINIO_SECRET_KEY`, there was no check rejecting a
   future `CORS_ORIGINS=*` misconfiguration at boot in production (which, combined with the existing
   `allow_credentials=True`, would be a real credentialed-wildcard CORS hole). Added the same fail-fast
   check pattern.

All four fixes re-verified against the full 93-test backend suite (still 93/93 passing) after rebuilding
the Docker images — not just diffed and assumed correct.

**Confirmed clean, no action needed**: WebSocket auth on `/messages/ws/{conversation_id}` genuinely checks
conversation membership, not just login status. IDOR checks on `applications`, `network`, `saved_jobs`,
and `groups` routers are consistently correct — `projects/router.py`'s ownership-check pattern is in fact
the *correct* reference implementation; findings #1 and #2 above were sibling endpoints in other domains
that didn't reuse it. File upload validates by magic bytes (not just extension), enforces a server-side
size cap, and randomizes stored object names — real protections, not test-mocked theater. No SSRF surface
(no endpoint fetches a user-supplied URL). No raw SQL string interpolation anywhere. No
`dangerouslySetInnerHTML`/`innerHTML` in the frontend. The generic exception handler never leaks stack
traces regardless of `DEBUG`. All `/admin/*` and `/moderation/*` endpoints live-verified to return 403 for
a non-admin token.

## E2E test suite (Playwright) — Phase 10

Added `tests/e2e/` (a new npm workspace, using the `playwright`/`@playwright/test` dependency that was
already present in the root `package.json` but never wired up). Five real journeys, all run against the
live Docker Compose stack (not mocked): engineer register→browse→search→open job→save→apply; engineer
recommendations render real backend-driven data; company register→create profile→post a job→reach
candidate discovery; admin login→dashboard with real stats; and an authorization-boundary check
(non-admin token hitting `/admin/stats` gets 403). All 5 pass. Wired into `.github/workflows/ci.yml` as a
new `e2e` job that boots the real stack, seeds demo data, and runs the suite — this is the CI job most
likely to catch a regression that unit tests miss, since it exercises actual HTTP round-trips through the
real frontend.

## UI polish pass (2026-08-11) — Phase 8

Reviewed all 27 screens visually (desktop + mobile, using the screenshot tool already present at
`screenshot-pages/tools/capture-screenshots.js` but not previously run against a working build). The
overall visual quality is genuinely good — consistent "enterprise" design system, clean cards, real
loading/empty states throughout, no placeholder-text-left-in-production epidemic. Two concrete issues
found and fixed:

1. **`/network` page used a completely different, hand-rolled dark theme** (`#080e1c` background, purple
   gradients, all inline styles) while every other screen in the app uses the consistent light
   "enterprise" system (`card-enterprise`, `btn-primary-brand`, `badge-ent-*`). This was jarring —
   navigating from any other page to Network felt like landing on a different product. Rewrote the page
   using the same Tailwind utility classes as the rest of the app, preserving all functionality (tabs,
   stats, send-request panel, accept/decline, search, empty/loading states) and DOM `id`s. Verified with
   `tsc --noEmit`, `eslint`, and a rebuilt container + re-screenshotted comparison.
2. **Homepage's three feature cards had identical placeholder body copy** — "Remote AI Platform keeps the
   next step clear for professionals, companies, and platform administrators," repeated verbatim under
   all three distinct headings ("Search with useful filters," "Review evidence, not hype," "Keep hiring
   work organized"). Replaced with real, distinct copy describing what the platform actually does for
   each of those three claims.

**Lower-priority, logged but not fixed**: the mobile layout for `/jobs` (and other pages with a persistent
left sidebar of career/hiring navigation links) puts that full navigation list above the actual page
content in DOM order, so a mobile visitor scrolls past ~20 nav links before reaching jobs. Not broken —
everything is reachable and functional — but a real ordering/UX improvement for a future pass (would need
a responsive reorder, e.g. moving the sidebar into a collapsible drawer on small viewports).

## $0 deployment prep (2026-08-11) — Phase 11

Wrote and verified (locally, against real infra — not just written and assumed) the config needed for a
genuinely free deployment: `infra/deploy/render.yaml` (API), `apps/web/vercel.json` (frontend),
`.github/workflows/scheduled-job-sync.yml` (replaces Celery beat's job-sync cron with no hosted
Redis/worker needed), and `docs/DEPLOYMENT_ZERO_COST.md` (step-by-step account setup, env vars, and
honest free-tier limitations). Actual account creation and deploy execution require the user's own
free-tier accounts (Render/Vercel/Supabase) — that step hasn't happened yet.

Two real problems were found and fixed while writing these, not just documented:

1. **`apps/api/Dockerfile`'s multi-stage build order would have deployed the wrong image on Render.**
   Render's Docker runtime has no target-selection field (confirmed against Render's own docs/community
   forum — it always builds whichever stage is last when no `--target` is given), and the file's last
   stage was `test`, not `production`. Reordered so `production` is last; verified with a plain
   `docker build` (no `--target`) that the resulting image's CMD is now `start-production.sh`, and
   re-verified all existing named-target builds (`docker-compose.yml`'s explicit `target: production` /
   `target: test`) and the full 93-test suite still work identically after the reorder.
2. **The storage client (minio SDK) would not have worked with Supabase Storage's S3-compatible endpoint
   in production.** Supabase's S3 endpoint includes a path (`/storage/v1/s3`), and the minio Python SDK's
   client only accepts a bare `host:port` — a known incompatibility (there's an open minio-js issue about
   exactly this). Migrated `apps/api/app/core/storage.py` from the `minio` SDK to `boto3`, which supports
   path-based endpoints. Verified live against the real local MinIO container (not just unit test mocks):
   registered a user, created a profile, uploaded a real PDF through the live API, confirmed the object
   was actually stored and byte-for-byte retrievable via a presigned URL generated by the new code. All 93
   backend tests and all 5 E2E journeys still pass after the migration.

## Known debt intentionally left unfixed (out of scope for this pass)

1. **962 pre-existing `ruff check` violations** in `apps/api`. Far too large to fix blindly in one pass
   without risking unrelated behavior changes; many are auto-fixable but require review, not a blanket
   `--fix`. Left as a non-blocking CI signal (`continue-on-error: true`) rather than silently ignored or
   falsely claimed clean. Pay down incrementally.
2. **AI failure is silent.** No visible signal to the user/admin when resume parsing or job enrichment
   fell back to generic defaults because the AI provider was unavailable. The admin dashboard's
   `/admin/ai-usage` call is a partial start; individual profile/job records aren't flagged as
   AI-enriched-vs-defaulted. Not fixed in this pass — a real feature, not a one-line fix.
3. **"Save engineer" is a genuinely missing feature**, not a stub — no backend model/endpoint exists for
   companies to bookmark candidates (unlike the mirrored, working `saved_jobs` feature on the engineer
   side). The mega-prompt's product spec calls for this; building it (model + migration + repository +
   endpoints + frontend) is a real feature addition, not a bug fix, and wasn't done in this pass.
4. **Real Keycloak RS256/JWKS token verification is not implemented** — see fix #2 above; the docstring
   now accurately reflects this rather than overclaiming it.

## What does NOT need fixing (contrary to what stale docs might suggest)

- The frontend is not a facade — 23/23 hooks are wired to real, live backend endpoints.
- Chat/networking and the project workspace are substantially complete systems, not stubs.
- Job aggregation, dedup, and per-source failure isolation all work correctly.
- No committed secrets, no direct paid-AI-SDK imports, dependencies are current and not EOL.

## Phase 12: live deployment to Render + Vercel + Supabase (2026-08-12)

Deployed for real via each platform's official CLI (`render`, `vercel`, `supabase`, all device-code or
token authenticated — no dashboard clicking required beyond generating the two credentials Supabase's
CLI/API don't expose: a DB password reset and Storage S3 access keys). Four distinct bugs surfaced only
once real traffic hit the real deployed services — none of these were visible from code review or from
local Docker Compose, because local dev never routes through a URL-embedded, percent-encoded credential
or a PgBouncer pooler:

1. **`CORS_ORIGINS` crashed the app on boot the moment it was set via a real env var.** `pydantic-settings`
   2.6.1 JSON-decodes any env var mapped to a `List[str]` field before any validator runs; a plain URL
   string isn't valid JSON. Fixed by storing it as a `str` field (not "complex" to pydantic-settings) with
   a computed property that splits on commas. Never caught locally because `docker-compose.yml` never
   overrides `CORS_ORIGINS`, always falling back to the Python-level default list.
2. **Alembic's `env.py` crashed on a percent-encoded `DATABASE_URL`.** The DB password contained `@`,
   requiring URL-encoding to `%40` — but `Config.set_main_option()` goes through `configparser`, which
   treats a bare `%` as interpolation syntax. Fixed by escaping `%` as `%%` before calling
   `set_main_option`.
3. **`DuplicatePreparedStatementError` against Supabase's transaction-mode pooler (port 6543).** asyncpg
   names prepared statements deterministically (`__asyncpg_stmt_1__`, ...) and doesn't deallocate them
   before disconnecting; PgBouncer in transaction mode hands the same backend to different clients without
   resetting that state, so unrelated connections collide. Got *worse* with each debugging attempt as more
   backends accumulated a stale statement — `statement_cache_size=0` alone (the officially documented
   asyncpg+PgBouncer fix) did not resolve it. Root fix: use Supabase's **session-mode pooler (port 5432)**
   instead, which gives each client a dedicated backend like a normal Postgres connection. Verified
   robust across 3 repeated full migration+seed runs against the real database, not just once.
4. **Render's Docker runtime has no build-target-selection field** (confirmed against Render's own
   docs/community forum) — already fixed in Phase 11 by reordering `Dockerfile` stages; re-confirmed live
   here since this was the first real Render build.

All four fixes verified two ways: locally against the real live Supabase database/pooler (not local
Postgres, which can't reproduce pooler-specific bugs) before pushing, and then by the deploy actually
succeeding on Render afterward. All 93 backend tests continued passing throughout.

**Also found**: `vercel deploy` from a subdirectory of an npm-workspaces monorepo only uploads that
subdirectory — `cd ../.. && npm ci` (this app's install command, needed for workspace hoisting) then
fails with no lockfile in scope. Fixed by linking the Vercel project with `root-directory` set via
`vercel project update`, deploying from the repo root instead, and adding `.vercelignore` (a CLI-only
deploy doesn't reliably respect nested `.gitignore` the way a git-integrated import does — an initial
attempt tried to upload 803MB including `node_modules`, `.next` cache, and `.turbo` cache before that was
in place).

## Environment notes for future sessions

- This machine has no `python3.11`; use the Docker `api` container for anything requiring the exact
  pinned Python version (migrations, pytest).
- The local Docker Compose stack was left running after this audit (healthy) rather than torn down, to
  save re-boot time for the next phase. Tear down with `npm run docker:down` if not needed.
- `docs/AGENT_HANDOFF.md<` (literal `<` in the filename) is a shell-redirection artifact from a prior
  session, not a real file that was ever supposed to keep that name — safe to remove or rename in a later
  cleanup pass.
